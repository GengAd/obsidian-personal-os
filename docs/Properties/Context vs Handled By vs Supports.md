# Context, Handled By, and Supports Properties

Sure ! You can see The "Context" property as an "Alignment" tool. "This project exists in the context of that goal, that goal exists in the context of that vision, that task exists in the context of that project "
While the Handled by property is used as a "delagation of action" tool. It basically says " The actions in that file are handled by (or delegated to) another file".
A lot of the time both can reference the same file, This task is in the context of a project, and is also handled by the same project because I don't want the task itself to come back from the engage feature I only want the project file to come back 
Best way to understant the difference is with a little example of a file where both are different. let's take an example with classes for a student. 
Let's say a student has a list of 5 books to read, each book for a different course. Let's say there is an "Activity" for each course. And for each book a Task is created to read it 
"Validate Course 1"  Activity is the context of" Read  Book 1" task
"Validate Course 2"  Activity is the context of" Read  Book 2" task
"Validate Course 3"  Activity is the context of" Read  Book 3" task
, you get the idea ðŸ˜‰
Now let's say that student want's to have a routine of "Read a course book" for 1 hour every day

A "Routine" Activity can be created to represent that routine. And all books that need to be red can be "Handled By" that routine. With a backlog widget in the routine to see the list of book that are still not finished
Now "Read  Book 1 " task is in the "Context of" the "Validate Course 1" Activity. But "Handled by" the " Read for 1 hour a course book" Routine.
Does it make more sense ?

Yes, that helps, thank you.
But now I need to also throw in the "Supports" property
William.A.A. â€” 4/9/2025 9:07 AM
The "Supports" Property is here to show that a file "supports" another one, it sees more usage in PKM. And the big difference with the context property is that the context is unique while the supports property can have a list of other files.
the "Coding in Typescript" Competence Supports the larger "Web development" Competence
A guide on how to configure a specific type of database supports A "Database management" competence
A map of content referencing 15 different description of database technologies supports Both a "Database management" competence and a "System  architecture" competence
those "supports" link are not to handle actions (likee the handled by property) or to handle alignment ( like context), but they are just a named and usefull relationship for knowledge pieces (It's what allows me to have the Competence as they are with lots of queris showing all the "supporting" material)

OK thanks, that helps clarify those three and their usage scenarios


What is a context ?
A context is another file without which the current file should not exist.
For example, a sub-project exists in the context of a project. Without the "parent" project, the sub-project should not even exists.

Why use contexts ?
Contexts are by no means required, and they can sometimes feel like they are providing the same utility as folders.
But they are extremely powerful to manage activities and we strongly encourage to use them. While a folder tree can provide you with a structure to even organize non obsidian files, the context tree allow for the construction of very flexible views on your system.

Just visualize it, using context in Personal OS I'm able to :

Show a tree of all projects, subprojects and tasks, created to attain a goal.
Calculate how many actions are done each week for a given project (even if those actions are done in subprojects).
Show a pie chart graph of how many XP points I obtained last week for the different goals I have.


By declaring that a file is "Handled By" another file, the handled file is now considered part of that other file backlog and will not show-up automatically in the "Engage" feature, but you can still automatically access it using the "Engage current file" command (ALT + 3, alternative third workflow) while in the overarching backlog file, you can also see a list of "Handled" files in the backlog file by using the file backlog widget.
