Backlogs are suuuper powerfull, i manage a lot of things with them
it's very convenient to either do lists of 'random things to review' , Very good also for "habit stacking" by allowing recurring routines to have "various" content in them. The Batch trigger review routine is a good example
I would say to get it you should set-up 2 very obvious backlogs and see how they impact you
The first one I basically advise to everybody is a processing backlog
The Batch system processing routine is already there and should be a daily routine, I like it around noon but it can be around the end of afternoon, I don't advise for early morning (because our brain has basically a bad garbage collector :p )
and evenings at least for me tends to prevent me from properly "come down" and sleep easily
But then what you do is list all the "Things" that you need to process regularly, put a correct recurrence, and handle it by this routine
