# Getting Started with Personal OS

> [!NOTE]
> Personal OS is built for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), which you can get [here](https://obsidian.md/download)

## Personal OS Plugin

The Obsidian Personal OS plugin is a powerful addition to Obsidian, designed to optimize your workflow by automating the management of tasks, reviews, and focus areas within your Obsidian environment. By alleviating the burden of decision-making regarding which file to prioritize, the plugin employs an automated selection process to direct your attention efficiently, drawing inspiration from the GTD (Getting Things Done) methodology. However, strict adherence to GTD principles is not mandatory for benefiting from this tool.

## Personal OS Vault

Personal OS is a gamified life system that helps you get clarity, build structure, and actually do things.
