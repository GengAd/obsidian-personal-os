Here let me copy paste just the interesting bit from a (way too long xD) conversation I had on Danny hatcher discord : 
From that point I see three degrees of knowledge seeking that can all be helped by a PKM practice: 
- Activity oriented PKM : goal is to acquire knowledge necessary for a specific activity. (For example I need to know if my client is allergic to peanut before inviting him to a peanut based dinner )
- what I call " Competence" oriented PKM : goal is to acquire knowledge necessary for a specific skill ( let's say making small talk) that is recognized as useful for the subject ( meaning that the skill is applied in existing or projected activities )
- What I call "reference" oriented PKM : goal is to acquire knowledge for knowledge sake, it does not need to be directly  applicable but it  can potentially be applied by anyone for any relevant Competence or activity.

The third one is obviously in theory the most potent if shared and applied. And my argument at the beginning was that most PKM practices are geared toward that one because it's the bread and butter of researchers and teachers . And those are the ones that are in the direst need of managing knowledge. 
But at least for me the switch to the second one was what made everything "click" to actually get some value out of a PKM practice.
