Download the Personal OS vault [here](https://2ly.link/266rV)!

## Method 1 - Extract and Open Vault

1. Download the Personal OS vault (link above)
2. Extract/unzip the vault and move the extracted folder to the preferred location on your computer
3. In Obsidian, open the "Manage vaults" screen
    - If you have existing vaults, click on the vault switcher and then "Manage vaults..."
    - If you do not have existing vaults, this is the default screen when launching Obsidian
4. Click the "Open" button next to "Open folder as vault", then browse to and select the folder containing the vault files
5. At the prompt asking "Do you trust the author of this vault?" select "Trust author and enable plugins"
6. Wait approximately 10-15 seconds, close the vault and open it again

:::tip

When extracting the files, you may find that all of the vault files are in a folder within the folder created by the unzip utility. While this does not prevent the vault from working, you can move all of the vault contents from the nested folder up one level and delete the now empty nested folder to avoid unecessary or excess folder structure.

For example, if you stored your vaults in a folder named "vaults":
`.../vaults/PersonOS-Vault/PersonalOS-Vault/.obsidian/...`
vs
`.../vaults/PersonOS-Vault/.obsidian/...`
